#  C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Overview
 This project focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in C and understanding the concept of Big O notation to elevate time complexity. The project aims to acieve the following learning objectives:
	- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
	- Understand and apply Big O notation to evaluate the time complexity of algorithms.
	- Learn how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
	- Explore stable sorting algorithms.

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a new line.
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder.
- **Coding Style:** Use the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- **Global Variables:** Avoid using global variables.
- **Functions per File:** No more than 5 functions per file.
- **Standard Library:** Unless specified otherwise, do not use standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- **Testing:** Main.c files are provided as examples for testing. Do not push them to your repo.

## Compilation
To compile your code, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 your_source_files.c -o executable_name
